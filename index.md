This is the webpage for a class: _DGST 301A, "Creative Coding"_ at the [University of Mary Washington](http://www.umw.edu).

On this site, I've listed all the details [about the class](/creativecoding/about), including a tentative [schedule](/creativecoding/schedule), a description of the [projects](/creativecoding/projects) that students will be working on, and a list of some helpful [resources](/creativecoding/resources).

I'll also be posting [updates](/creativecoding/updates) as the semester goes on and I add things.

Obviously, this site is mainly intended for [students](/creativecoding/roster), but since we're working on the open web here, feel free to look around even if you're not a student.

If you have any questions or concerns about what you see here, please [contact me](http://www.zachwhalen.net/contact).
