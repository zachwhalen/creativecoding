## Software

All of the software and tools you'll need for this class will be free to use. There are many of these, but in order to access them all and complete the projects, you'll need at least the following:

 - A computer that you can bring to class every day. (Mac, Windows, Linux are all fine. A Chromebook might be tricky but we'll try it.)
 - A <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub account</a>.
