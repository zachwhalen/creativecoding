This class is a brand-new Digital Studies elective at the University of Mary Washington. This website -- hosted in Github pages -- is intended to provide information and coordination for students. It is, of course, also open here for anyone to browse, examine, or adapt this content.

This page is also officially the syllabus for this class.

## Overview


## Learning Outcomes
It is my hope that, by completing this course, successful students will:

* Be able to speak about their creative work critically, both process and product.
* Reflect on the value of the creative process.
* Evaluate and select appropriate digital tools, programming languages, and composition methods to accomplish their creative goals.
* Reflect on and evaluate creative digital work by others, including both peers in the class as well as in society.

## Requirements
There is one required book for this class, _Virtual Muse: Experiments in Computer Poetry_. (1996) by Charles O. Hartmann, but many more helpful things are listed [on the resources page](/resources).

You should bring a laptop to class every day.

## Grading
For this class, I am implementing an "ungrading" policy. I will give students feedback on work submitted, and note when it has been completed and submitted, but it will be up to each student to make an argument on their own behalf to justify the final grade that they think they've earned by the end of the semester.

Each [project](/project) will have a list of criteria and goals, and a student must satisfy all of those criteria (or propose and complete reasonable alternatives) and participate in peer workshops in order for that project to be considered "complete."

### Distribution
Students should use the outomes listed above and the relative weights for each assignment listed below when making their final grade justification.

<table>
	<tr><th>Assignment</th><th>Relative Weight</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Projects (7)</td><td>50%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Participation</td><td>30%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Final Portfolio</td><td>20%</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### Participation

Participation is an important part of this class, so it's listed as 30% of your overall grade. Here's what I mean by participation:

* Be in class every day, on time, ready to work on the material at hand
* Use Slack to keep up to date with your peers, share your work, and give feedback to others
* Complete and share in-class activities and short homework "mini-projects" in class or in Slack
* Participate fully in workshopping your peers' creative projects
* Commit yourself to knowing and at least getting along with everyone else in the class
* Avoid behavior in class or in Slack that would distract others or alienate their participation in any way

### Logistics

You'll be working with Github quite a bit this semester, and you should also create a blog that you'll use to share and reflect on your projects. Unless otherwise specified, a completed project should consist of:

 * Some code you've shared in Github 
 * A sample of your output
 * A blog entry describing your process, reflecting on the outcome, and linking to your code in Github

 When all this is done, share your blog post in Slack, and submit it in Canvas.



## Policies and Expectations

### Technology in the Classroom
You are welcome to use computers during class, including tablets, smartphones, whatever — so long as what you’re doing isn’t distracting to someone else. I simply ask you to be responsible. Proper uses may include taking notes, reviewing the reading material, looking up something related, working on a project for class, or participating in a constructive backchannel conversation such as Slack or Twitter. Improper uses may include watching movies, and working on homework assignments for other classes. If what you’re doing is a distraction to me or others, I may ask you to stop. 

### Decorum
Students are expected to treat the instructor and fellow students with the appropriate degree of respect, both in class and in online discussions. Communication, either in person or through electronic media, that is deemed abusive, threatening, or harassing in nature will not be tolerated.

### Content
Through the course of this semester, we may look at a wide array of content including literature, film, comics, television, memes, and any manner of things that people post on the Internet. It is possible that some of this material may be disturbing, offensive, or upsetting, possibly including subject matter or themes related to race, sexuality or violence. For certain conversations to take place, it is sometimes important that we grapple with these things, and I will always treat all such material with appropriate maturity and as much clarity as possible. I expect you to do the same. However, if you find for some reason that discussing a particular text is too upsetting or traumatic, it is reasonable to excuse yourself from that discussion.

### Status of Student Work
Much of the work you’ll be creating for my class will be posted online and, therefore, shared with a public audience. Some of the work may also be shared with others in the class via a closed system like Slack. Wherever possible, we will discuss and think carefully about the divide between public and private sharing and when to post what, where. All grades and feedback will be in Canvas or some other private medium, only accessible by you and me.

### Academic Dishonesty
The UMW Honor System is in effect for our course. I may authorize specific assignments as collaborative work, but all other work must be your own, as per Article 1, Sections 1 and 2 of the University of Mary Washington Student Honor Code. Academic dishonesty typically boils down to taking credit for someone else’s work. Whether you’ve done so accidentally or maliciously, it’s still an honor violation. Some examples include:

* Including a quote in a blog post without identifying the source of that quote
* Using an image in a blog post without permission from its copyright holder
* Asking another student to “edit” your paper for you
* Creating a blog entry or essay that is mostly quotes, even properly attributed quotes

Using code and snippets from others is acceptable when those snippets are shared with amenable licenses (such as MIT) or in a platform where copying is expected, like [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). You should still acknowledge those sources in your source code or in discussions of your work.

### Disability Resources
The [Office of Disability Resources](https://academics.umw.edu/disability/) has been designated by the University as the primary office to guide, counsel, and assist students with disabilities. If you have a disability that you think will make some part of this class difficult, please get in touch with ODR to help coordinate your accommodations. Please [make an appointment with me](http://zachwhalen.youcanbook.me), and bring your accommodation letter with you to the appointment. I will hold any information you share with me in the strictest confidence unless you give me permission to do otherwise. 

The Office of Disability Resources has [a website](https://academics.umw.edu/disability/), or their phone number is 540-654-1266.
